## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:

- Any episode/movie/OVA etc. not included is either:
  - Released **as hardsub only**, or  
  - I simply **forgot to add it**  

  You can remind me of any available **softsub** episode via my Discord:  
  **`akai_3m_amouro`**

- **Translator credits are preserved** in the filenames.  
  Any file without a translator name is either:
  - By an unknown translator  
  - Or uploaded without credit originally  

  So I didn‚Äôt include the name in those cases.
